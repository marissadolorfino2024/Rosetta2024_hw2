## Objectives for this assignment:
* Draw ASCII art pine trees
* Turn in homework assignment


This is the first assignment that actually requires coding. If you have not taken a CS 101 course, then the best way for you to spend the next month is in daily efforts to try and program. The less time you put into preparing for boot camp, the less you will get out of it.


## Draw ASCII art pine trees

It should hopefully not come as a shock to anyone, but the PyRosetta+ML Code School focuses on the Python interface to the Rosetta libraries and the applications of machine learning-based methods for macromolecular modeling. For this assignment, we are going to check-in on some of your basic python skills. I would like you to channel your inner Bob Ross and write a python program that draws ASCII art pine trees.

You will complete this coding challenge in the [pine trees Colab notebook] (pine_trees.ipynb). This notebook has a set of instructions for you to follow.

* [ ] Complete the [pine trees Colab notebook](pine_trees.ipynb)

## Turn in homework assignment

You will need to upload your completed notebook to your GitHub repository. To complete the assignment, you have made changes to the file `pine_trees.ipynb`.  Please delete the old version of the notebook and then upload the new version so that there are no duplicates.

Now you need to commit and push your changes to your repository. You can do this by following the instructions in the GitHub tutorial from HW1.

## Final notes

Your first instinct should be to ask your peers for help using the Slack channel. No need to be shy! Let's keep Deniz's DMs free for important things like cat pictures and memes.

You are encouraged to reach out to your peers and the teaching team while working through this assignment. You can use the Slack channel to ask questions and discuss the homework. Thoroughly read through the assignment and attempt to complete it on your own before asking for help. When asking for help, be sure to include all relevant details and a screenshot of any error messages you are receiving (if applicable). 

## Answer key

The answer key for this assignment will be posted after the due date for the assignment has passed.
